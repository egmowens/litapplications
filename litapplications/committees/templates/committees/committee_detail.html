  <strong><em>For all committees</em></strong>, please consider:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Diversity</strong>: have we ensured the members represent a range
      of personal backgrounds, library types, etc.?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Skills</strong>: have we supplied appointees with skills the
      committee needs to flourish?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Skills development</strong>: are we giving appointees a chance
      to learn new skills that they value?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Initiative</strong>: have we appointed people who get things done?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Glossary</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Applicants</strong> have submitted a volunteer form and
    expressed interest in this committee.</li>
    <li><strong>Under consideration</strong> means the committee is
    evaluating this candidate for this committee but has not yet made a
    decision.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommended</strong> means the committee recommends that
    the VP appoint this candidate to this committee.</li>
    <li><strong>Accepted</strong> means the VP has sent an appointment
    invitation and the candidate has accepted it. Hooray!</li>
    <li><strong>Not recommended</strong> means the committee has evaluated this
    candidate and does not recommend appointing them to this committee.</li>
    <li><strong>Declined</strong> means candidate received an appointment
    letter but declined to serve on the committee.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Our goal is to get candidates moved into a final status (accepted, not
    recommended, or declined) until committees are fully staffed.
